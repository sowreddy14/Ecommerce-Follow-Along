## Milestone 3: Backend Added

In this milestone, we have successfully added the backend for our e-commerce application. This includes the following key features:

### Key Features:
- **API Endpoints**: Implemented several API endpoints for handling user authentication, product management, and order processing.
- **Database Integration**: Integrated MongoDB to store and retrieve data, ensuring a seamless connection between the frontend and backend.
- **Authentication**: Added user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure user data and restrict access to certain endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling to provide informative responses and ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Middleware**: Used middleware to handle tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, and managing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

This milestone lays the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application, providing essential functionality to support user interactions and data management. We will continue to build on this foundation in upcoming milestones to enhance the features and improve the user experience.

## Milestone 4: Backend Enhancements
In this milestone, we made several important updates to our e-commerce application. Here's a summary of what we did:

### Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, we accomplished the following:
1. **Created a User Model**: This is like a blueprint for how we store user data, such as name, email, and password, in the database.
2. **Created a User Controller**: This part of the server manages user data. It handles actions like adding a new user or getting user information.
3. **Enabled File Uploads with Multer**: Multer is a tool that helps our app accept and store files (like profile pictures) uploaded by users.

### 1. What‚Äôs a Model?
A model is like a detailed map or plan. When we create a User Model, we're designing how a user‚Äôs data will look in the database. Think of it like drawing a blueprint for a house. The model defines what information we need to store for each user.

### 2. What‚Äôs a Controller?
A controller is a part of the server that manages what happens when someone interacts with our app. For example, if someone wants to sign up, the controller handles the data sent to the server. Think of the controller as a "manager" of requests and responses, making sure everything goes smoothly.

### 3. File Uploads with Multer
Sometimes, users want to upload files like profile pictures. Multer is a tool that makes it easy to upload files to our server. It helps us store user images in the backend, like a virtual file cabinet for storing pictures.

## Milestone 5: Signup Page Added

In this milestone, we have successfully added the Signup page to our e-commerce application. This includes the following key features:
- **User Registration Form**: A form that allows new users to register by providing their name, email, password, and profile picture.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented validation for the name, email, and password fields to ensure data integrity and provide feedback to the user.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Added an eye icon that allows users to toggle the visibility of the password field for convenience.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload a profile picture during registration. The image is displayed as a preview before submission.
- **Form Submission**: On successful validation, the form data is submitted to the server using Axios. The server processes the registration request and stores the user data in the database.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling to inform users of any issues with their input.

## Milestone 6: Database Added to Signup Page

In this milestone, we have successfully connected the Signup page to the database. This includes the following key features:
- **User Data Storage**: When users register, their information (name, email, hashed password, and profile picture URL) is now stored in MongoDB.
- **Backend Validation**: Ensured that duplicate email registrations are prevented and added server-side validation to enhance security.
- **Encrypted Passwords**: Used bcrypt to hash user passwords before storing them in the database for added security.
- **Improved User Experience**: Users now receive a confirmation message after successful registration.

## Milestone 7: Logic Added to Signup Page and login page

This milestone focuses on adding robust logic to the Signup and Login pages, improving data validation, user authentication, error handling, database integration, and overall user experience. These enhancements lay the groundwork for a secure and user-friendly application, ensuring that user interactions are smooth and reliable.

Feel free to reach out if you need further details or have any questions!

### Milestone 8: Home Page with Product Display

In this milestone, we've added a Home Page to our e-commerce application, where our products are prominently displayed. Here are the key features and improvements:

#### Key Features:
1. **Product Display**:
   - The Home Page now showcases a variety of products with images, names, and prices.
   - Each product is displayed in a grid layout for easy browsing.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Enhanced the user interface with intuitive navigation, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable shopping experience.
   - Added hover effects and animations to improve visual appeal and interactivity.

#### Summary:
This milestone focuses on creating an engaging Home Page where users can easily browse and explore our products. By adding responsive design. we have significantly improved the user experience. This update marks an essential step in making our e-commerce application user-friendly and visually appealing.
